# FYP-Crawler
University Final Year Project. Also one heck of a bodge job. 

Part of a university final year project to analyse public messages and shared files from telegram for threat intelligence analysis.

Python Script contained entirely in Mod3.py - should just run as is and will leave the bot running for as long as the python script is in place, so long as it has the relevent APIs provided. 

REQUIREMENTS:
You will need to MANUALLY set up its data storage directories on install where it will read/write, and change the code accordingly.
